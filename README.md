Notes:
* Thanks for all the support with the project and the understanding, we hope you enjoy our game.

* General notice:
    The project that is being submitted does not follow the proposed UML presented in class. As discussed with Prof. Tareque, and Mrs Wilson we supplied an explaination and proposed fix for if we had more time. This is stored in the design.pdf inside of the docs/design directory, our help guide is also located in this directory.
* Running the game:
  * To simplify the combat for the marker they can use (2) for all combat options to guarantee a win. 
  * The correct answer to the "How many Birds" question is 2.
  * To succesfully navigate the rooms it is: (1,1,1,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,1).
  * The strength potion in the shop when interacting with the raven will result in GAME OVER.
  * The correct answer to the last riddle is 1.
